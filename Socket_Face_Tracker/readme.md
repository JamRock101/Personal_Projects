Programmed an RTOS-based  face-tracking tool using the Tiva TM4C123GH6PM, Beaglebone-Black Single-Board-Computer and ST7789 LCD to use OpenCV to track human faces in front of my laptop camera. 
This data would then be sent to my Beaglebone-Black via socket communication and normalised into usable X, Y, height and width values that could be sent to my Tiva board which would then output rectangular outlines of the detected face’s position and size on the LCD.
